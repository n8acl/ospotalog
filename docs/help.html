<br>

This program was designed as a lightweight, no frills logging program. There is no rig control. There are no maps. There are no graphics. It's just a plain and simple 
logging program that is OS agnostic. Since you can run PHP on any platform and the software is accessed from a browser, any OS can run it, making it more robust and versitile.<br>

<h3>Header Information</h3>
This consists of navigation buttons and will appear on every page in the program for easy navigation.

<ul>
    <li>Home: This button takes you to the home screen, which is the main loggin screen where most things take place.</li>
    <li>Settings: This is where the settings are set for the program that help control most aspects.</li>
    <li>Dashboard: This is the contest dashboard that can be run on another screen for others at the contest site to be able to see what is going on. 
        This helps to keep people from looking over the sholder of the logger and bothering the operator and logger with questions during the contest</li>
    <li>Help: This help document.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Home</h3>
This is where all the logging takes place. This is the main page for the contest.<br><br>


First you will see the header section. This is described above.<br><br>


Next is the logging section. Here you see:<br>
<ul>
    <li>Your Local Park information. This is the park you are in along with it's OSPOTA ID, WWFF ID and POTA ID, in case they should be needed.</li>
    <li>Your Exchange. This is your cllsign and park id. This is so you have easy reference for he contest.</li>
    <li>The next line has the local time and UTC time. This is just for reference. This is also not real time, it is a snap shot of time from when the page was last reloaded. If you want to see the current time, just reload the page.<br>
    This is is also where you set the band you are working and also what band privledges based on the licence class you set on the settings page. <br>
    To set the band, choose the band you will be working from the drop down and click the set button. The page will reload and the new band set.</li>
    <li>Callsign Received: This is the callsign that you get from teh other station.</li>
    <li>Ohio State Park ID: This is the Park ID of the other station, like LMI for Little Miami or ADA for Adams lake.</li>
    <li>State or DX: If the other station is not in an Ohio State Park, you would put their state, or if outside the country, DX.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>PLEASE NOTE: If a park ID is entered, do not enter a state. If a state is entered, park ID should be blank. PLease do not do like LMI and OH.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Finally in this section are the buttons under the fields:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Submit: This will save the entry to the log database and check for a dupe. If the station is a dupe, it will not save it and will notify you and clear the fields. Otherwise if the contact is not a dupe, it will be saved with no notification. The contacted logged will appear in the grids below.</li>
        <li>Check Dupe: This will manually check your log for a dupe. If the station is a dupe, it will notify you and clear the entry fields to reset. If the contact is not a dupe, it will let you know and leave the contact information in the fields.</li>
        <li>Clear: If you make a mistake, click this to clear out the entry fields and try again.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

Last on this page is the statistics sections (from left to right):
<ul>
    <li>Contacts grids: This will show the last 10 contacts for the current band you are working and the last 10 contacts over all under that.</li>
    <li>Score/Statistics Box: This shows the what your current score is and total contacts, parks worked and states worked.</li>
    <li>Parks worked/to be worked grids: These show what parks have been worked and what parks still need to be worked.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Settings</h3>
This is where all the settings and configurations for the program are handled. This page is broken up into roughly 3 sections:

<ul>
    <li>Settings Section:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Contest Callsign: This is your callsign that you will be using for your operation. This can be your personal callsign or the callsign of a group or organization.</li>
        <li>Club Name: This is the name of either ther person or the group that is operating.</li>
        <li>Location: This is the park or state you are working from.</li>
        <li>License Class: The class of license of the callsign being used. This is needed for the frequency band spread on the first page.</li>
        <li>Opeartors: If this is a group event, you can put the callsigns of the other operators here.</li>
        <li>Will Submit Via Cabrillo Format?: This is used to determine whether to include the cabrillo bonus score.</li>
    </ul>
    
    Once you have made your changes, click the Update Button, or to clear out the fields, click clear.
    <li>Contact Information: The OSPOTA commitee wants contact information submitted in the Cabrillo file when the log is submitted, so this section is what sets that. This can be a person or group, they just need contact information in case 
        they need to get ahold of someone with questions.
    </li>
    <li>Data Control Buttons:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Delete Database: This will clear out the database for a new contest. It resets the log database.</li>
        <li>Database Cabrillo Export: This will export the file in the correct cabrillo format for submission to the OSPOTA committee. The program will compile the log and then ask you to save the file.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Dashboard</h3>
This a screen that is designed to be run on a seperate monitor as a dashboard some place seperaete from the operating area. I know that I get annoyed with "Hey how are we doing? " questions all the time when I am operating the radio or logging
so this was designed as a way that people can see what is going on. This could be run on a second monitor turned around on the operating table or on a Raspberry pi tied to a seperate monitor on the other side of the operating site
for others to see. <br><br>
